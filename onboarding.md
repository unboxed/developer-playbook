# Onboarding

Welcome to Unboxed! 

Before you can properly get started, there are a few things that you’ll need to do.

This playbook has been broken down into different areas such as guidance on getting local setup done, getting a mentor/buddy, applications we work on, developer resources and our development principles.

Please work your way through the various sections and feel free to copy the set up steps to a personal trello board if you want to track your progress on these items. Any questions you may have, please don’t hesitate to ask.

If anything is out of place, outdated, confusing or you think adding something would be useful, please feel free to provide this feedback in the **#dev** Slack channel
