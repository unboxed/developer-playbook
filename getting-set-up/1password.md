# 1Password

We should be using [1Password](https://1password.com/ "‌") for storing all passwords and secrets and also setting up 2FA on here when possible.

You will need to ask in **#admin** if an account has not already been set up for you.

As a development team, we tend to use 1password to store things such as environment variables and secrets and there will be specific vaults for each of the projects we are working on.

The [1Password chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/1password-%E2%80%93-password-mana/aeblfdkhhhdcdjpifhhbdiojplfjncoa "‌") is handy for quicker access.
