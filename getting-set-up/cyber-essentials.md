# Cyber essentials

As part of meeting cyber essential standards, developers must be running day-to-day work in standard accounts (pain I know!) which means installing homebrew and other resources requiring admin privileges isn’t possible by default.

This is one reason we set up Docker on projects but you may still run projects natively if that’s your preferred way but there will be an added layer to installing some dependencies.

It is likely you will be given a laptop with [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/lp/en-gb/apple-mobile-device-management-mdm-jamf-shared/?attr=google_ads-brand-search-shared&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7aqkBhDPARIsAKGa0oKsErEICOsSssI7eYEK0dJw-_7lFdjtxA5S34OhqlqKVKYSkZcnSxsaAroAEALw_wcB "‌") pre-installed and set up with a standard and admin account by default.

In the unlikely case you are using your own machine or need to migrate a macOS admin account to a standard account you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/unboxed/developer-handbook/wiki/Migrating-a-macOS-admin-account-to-a-standard-account "‌"). Please ask Andrew White (CTO) for guidance and he will help with any questions you may have if anything is out of place.

However, if you are setting up fresh on a standard account, you will just need to look [here](https://github.com/unboxed/developer-handbook/wiki/Migrating-a-macOS-admin-account-to-a-standard-account#after-migration "‌") at how you can install new packages and manage services using `su` to open a shell as `unboxedadmin`
