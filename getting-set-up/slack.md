# Slack

We have a few development specific Slack channels that you may want to join.

**#dev**

- General channel for discussion between the development team at Unboxed. We probably use this one the most frequently.

**#devops**

- All things DevOps related (i.e. infrastructure, CI/CD, operations)

**#support**

- Channel related to support issues (mainly relevant if you are on the support rota)

**#aws-certification**

- Discussion about getting AWS certified

**#admin**

- Use this channel if you require access to something

There are also a few **#{app\_name}\_notifications** channels which are integrated with [AWS chatbot](https://aws.amazon.com/chatbot/ "‌") / [AppSignal](https://www.appsignal.com/ "‌") which may be relevant if you are in the support team or working on a particular project. The development team strive to have shared responsibility in addressing any infrastructure upgrades / EC2 instance refresh for the applications we manage.
