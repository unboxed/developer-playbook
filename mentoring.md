# Mentoring

Hopefully you have been given a mentor/buddy but if not please enquire about getting one! You can ask Ben Baumann or Vicky Peel about this.

Your mentor/buddy will give you an introduction to the wider team and help you with onboarding and getting the support you need.

If you want, please feel free to reach out individually to the other developers or wider team and have a (virtual) coffee to learn more about their responsibilities and to ask any questions you might have.
